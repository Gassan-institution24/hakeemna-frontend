      </Typography>

      <Typography paragraph>
        Part of your medical data stored on Hakeemna.com may be archived in electronic records held
        by the Third Party (medical service providers such as clinics or health centers) and may not
        be accessible to you. If you wish to obtain a copy, you must request it from them, not from
